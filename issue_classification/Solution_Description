This project is to automatically categorize consumer issues of a bank by analyzing the description of the issue.
The issues can be related to one of the products of the bank i.e. Mortgage, Bank Account or Service

--> Solution Approach ( As per the issue_classification notebook)
# Visualize the data set
# Apply Lemmatization & Stemming on the consumer complaint 
# Develop a TFIDF matrix for feature extraction
# Check the associated words to the categories
# Use TFIDF features as X and Product category as Y
# Apply Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, Random Forest & XGBoost
# We are getting the best accuracy for Linear SVM but Overfitting is happening with Linear SVM.
# We are getting the least over fitting in Logistic Regression, so we will go with Logistic Regression only to build the entire model
# Now as our model has been developed, we will be creating a deployable classifier - we will deploy that on Flask
