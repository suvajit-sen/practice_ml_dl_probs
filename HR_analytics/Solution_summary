-> previous_year_rating -- calculate the avg. rating where is_promoted = 1 & is_promoted = 0 and then impute the missing values
-> with these 2 avg. value in the respective rows, i.e. where previous_year_rating is null and is_promoted = 1, fill it with the avg 
-> of previous_year_rating where is_promoted = 1 and vice versa for rows with previous_year_rating null and is_promoted = 0
